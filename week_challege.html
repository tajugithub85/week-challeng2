      <h1>HOW TO MODIFY BOOTSTRAP SIMPLY AND EFFECTIVELY</h1>
      <p>Bootstrap is by no means the only HTML/CSS interface framework out there, but I think it’s safe to say that it changed the game. This kitchen-sink-included pile of code has made the design and development of many an app (and website) a lot easier, and popularized the massive HTML framework as a byproduct.</p>

      <P>Sadly, the sheer extent of its feature set appeals to the lazier aspects of human nature, and many of the people who choose to use it stick with the defaults. Now, mind you, the default styles and layout grid are not bad by any stretch of the imagination. They’re the result of a lot of hard work and extensive testing by the Twitter team. for more detail fill the form below.</P>
